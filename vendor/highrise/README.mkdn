# Highrise (0.12.0)

## What is it?

This gem provides a set of classes to access information on [Highrise][h] via the published [API][api]:

    Comment, Company, Email, Group, Case, Membership, Note, Person, Subject, Tag, Task, User. 

All these classes are inherited from ActiveResouce::Base. Refer to the [ActiveResouce][ar] documentation for more information.

## Installing

    gem install kmayer-highrise

### Dependencies

* ActiveResorce >= 2.2.2
* ActiveSupport >= 2.1
* Curb
* Hpricot

### Configure your key
    
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'highrise'
    
    Highrise::Base.site = 'http://your_api:login@your_site.highrisehq.com/'
    
or

    Highrise::Base.site = 'http://your_site.highrisehq.com'
    Highrise::Base.user = 'api-auth-token'

and, if you want [caching][c]:

    Highrise::Base.connection.cache_store= <your normal ActiveSupport::Caching options>
    
If you are using this in a Rails application, putting this code in a config/initializers/highrise.rb
file is recommended. See config_initializers_highrise.rb in the examples/ directory.

## Usage

    @tags = Highrise::Tag.find(:all)
    
    @people = Highrise::Person.find_all_across_pages(:params => {:tag_id => 12345})
    
    @person.tag!("VIP")
