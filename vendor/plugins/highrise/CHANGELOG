  * Version 0.12.0

  * Added store_options attribute, so fetches will work work with
    :mem_cache_store and :expires_in

2009-05-20 Ken Mayer <kmayer@bitwrangler.com>

  * Version 0.11.0

  * Added untag_id! to Taggable, in case you already know the id and don't
    need to search for it again.

  * Version 0.10.0

  * Simplified caching store interface, left configuration up to end-user with
    less magic

  * Removed version.rb module & tests. No one will ever use it, why clutter up
    the code.

2009-05-05 Ken Mayer <kmayer@bitwrangler.com>

  * Version 0.9.2
  
  * Refactored cachable to be more idiomatic ruby
  
  * Dropped the SHA1 hashing from cache_key

2009-05-04 Ken Mayer <kmayer@bitwrangler.com>

  * Version 0.9.0

  * Changed cache_store= interface to accept :none (to disable caching),
    :rails (to use the default Rails cache, whatever that happens to be), and,
    consequently, restores the lookup_store default behavior (given nil or
    empty options returns a new, default cache_store).

  * Documentation update. Created and back-filled CHANGELOG
  
2009-05-01 Ken Mayer <kmayer@bitwrangler.com>

  * Documentation update
  
  * Updated gemspec
  
2009-04-26 Ken Mayer <kmayer@bitwrangler.com>
  
  * Version 0.7.0

  * Refactored Tag & Taggable so ::Tag is a subclass of Base. This adds
    ::Tag.find(:all) to your quiver of tools. All existing functionality
    passes tests, but the interface to ::Tag.new has changed. You have to
    treat it like all of other ARes, that is, use a Hash (instead of
    positional parameters) to initialize the model.

  * Version 0.6.3

  * Support to tags refactored. Include curl helper to improve support for
    objects without ActiveResource base like 'tag' which needs a parse in a
    html document from a httprequest.
